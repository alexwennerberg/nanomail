# Nanomail

Nanomail is an ultra-lightwight internet mail protocol, inspired by email.
Unlike email, it is designed to be radically simple and easy to host yourself.

Think of it like [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) for email.

Read the [spec](spec.md) and/or check out the [reference implementation](./impl)

HEAVILY WIP. Mostly me sketching out ideas at this point
